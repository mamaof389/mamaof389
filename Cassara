Hey y'all. My name is Cassara. I'm I'm mother of 3 amazing little boys. I am currently going to college to get my Bacholor's in Human Services. Lord knows we need some good workers up in there. I am a single mother just trying to make by for my babies. I enjoy walks, out doors and looking at the stars. My pride and joy are my babies. Mess with them and I'll gladly rock that orange jump suite.
